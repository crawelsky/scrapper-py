['Walk on Water '];"I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackeningI know the mark's high, butter–
flies rip apart my stomachKnowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow,so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—I walk on water
But I ain’t no Jesus
(It’s the curse of the— it’s the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezesIt's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers discs setAlways in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustiveAnd I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplishedI'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's— it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, ohIt's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful messAt times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guessBut I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned onBut the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?Begs the question though
Especially after the methadoneAs yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawnThe crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline,the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behindAnd everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, ohIf I walked on water, I would drown'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alikeBitch, I wrote ""Stan"""
['Believe'];"And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck,and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (get it?)Sucker free, confidence highSuch a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (yeah)Another day in the life (uh)Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (say hi)I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (way in the sky)But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're youSo close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time, bombs and horseshoesSo I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuseI got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?Do you still believe in me?Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it downI'll never quit, do you still believe in me?Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (yeah)
When you retards can roll the diceBut beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a birdToo short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate AmericaI was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through itSince ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snareAnd I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despairThat double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your fuckin' switch, nothin' can compareDo you still believe in me?Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it downI'll never quit, do you still believe in me?Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke thatBut my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my packAnd I know that I always got Proof at my backI called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, soGive me that apron and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flowFake fans left you two-faced at the showLet heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a rowTrue statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its tollBut it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yetAnd when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assetsFanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to wasteMan, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâceStill you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose willDo you still believe?"
['Chloraseptic '];"Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (yeah)
To the English language
With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travelin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it outSimon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shookWire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go—hruhLike hair extensions, extra clipsBitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black,swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with thisI'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with

I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeahYeah, uh (haha), and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignantSkilled as Floyd is(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (woof)
I wouldn't heal with ointmentWay I'm kickin' these fairies tails
Should write a children's storybook (yeah, yeah, yeah)(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointedShe makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy CityPretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (woo!)Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude JudeI go there, you wouldn'tWell, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause…I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic

This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah (bitch!)You last went and threw your hat in the raceYou're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (yeah!)Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next lifeTalking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Colombian necktieAnd I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribeWhat kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh(Music, please!)Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an UziBut I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce SpringsteenGlued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe airHappily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it upChloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah"
['Untouchable'];"Hands up, officer don’t shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it’s no use
We ain’t ever gonna grasp what each other goes throughBlack boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of youPull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, outWe know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for youAnd just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of youFucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blueTime to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a...White boy, white boy, you're a rockstarMy momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to liveWhite boy, white boy, in your cop carBut I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieveWhite boy, white boy, you're untouchableThe world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstarBlack boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, manDon't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where’d you get the chip on your shoulder at?Why you kicking that soda can?Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffedYou don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boyWe're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trashFeels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactionsAs this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shitWhite boy, white boy, you're a rockstarMy momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to liveWhite boy, white boy, in your cop carBut I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieveWhite boy, white boy, you're untouchableThe world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstarSeems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstanceI'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banterBut that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financiallyAnd can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemateAnd can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black OpsThe block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spotYou always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stopSendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racistWait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd usWhen we tear it up’s the only time attention’s paid to usAnd education sucks,and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzzWhy is it they treat us like dryer lint?We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can’t escape the sirensDon’t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate’s the highest in
The lowest classes,And we’re trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil’s faceLions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gatsAnd we really love it when you think we’re guilty ‘cause we’re black""But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”
Single mother strugglin’ through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoesFuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat chargesWe done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got offSo we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congressBut they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthemWe raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney DangerfieldHome of the brave is still racist 'villeSo this whole nation feels like a plantation fieldIn a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killedGot you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the ""Land of the Free"" that made people slaves to build"
['River '];"I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river runHe's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get backIt's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-packShe's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacksKnife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her manI've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river runSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a boothI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursueWhy do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river runFuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybeThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangledWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run"

Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow ""whee""[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]

Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like meSomeone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeachedEverybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the streetThis chump barely even sleepsAll he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beakWhy you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? He's tryin' to divide usThis shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight oneTo pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride fromThis type of pickle that we're in is hard to dealBut there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it allFrom the cracks in the road that drove meDidn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with yaYou stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' upSo much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner""This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanicsTake it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal"
['Bad Husband '];"We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flightSo much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed youLike it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue lashing, then youLaughed at the stomach tat with the tomb stone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn't after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husbandYou were the beat I loved with a writer's blockI'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for Mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Givin' it one more try despite it allHow come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband(Dad)(you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husbandWe brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring endBut I'm sorry, Kim'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me
And I was thinkin' I was more in love than you wasWhen the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard ""Mockingbird""
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm gettin' choked upWe broke up, got back togetherHow come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband(Dad)(you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband"
['Tragic Endings '];"All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
I'm embarrased, I don't want no one else to seeI'm putty in her palms, I'm wrapped around her finger

That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's running through herShe's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it"

If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me companyBut fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit!
""Ain't steppin' to you, bitch,"" I say to myself

You'll give 'em not even a statementWalk in the arraignment
Shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiffGotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainmentIf y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lameYour hobby isn’t robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawin' them in the basement
Hardly fits your job descriptionOnly time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave itI need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still copping a feelLike Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill
Then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggyThis blonde fuck's reprehensible
Misconducts, never sensibleKiss my butt, my set of principles
Is gone, but till I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell
Just as big of a bitch as Donald—shit's on, bruh!Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicatoIvanka, stiff arm her while I'm hittin' on MelaniaAnd this song's for all ya'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some wormsI hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
I hope you offended
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turdsThese drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nurseryI'm imagining objects
So I'm batting cobwebs from a daddy longlegTwice her age and I'm actin' half itStarted rollin' all through those Klonopins like a bowlin' ballLike an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
And go through no withdrawalWhile I get fellatio and give a facial to
An interracial blow-up doll of Rachel DolezalYou're so appalled (""Em…""), so's my managerBitch, I am mature, fuck a pro careerThey ain't nowhere near, I'm way over hereMy competition can't see me—'cause I don't own a mirror!Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape linesI'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang timeDang knives're butcher than gay wivesAs the blade I push into caput'chaGotta stab a bitch at least eight times to make it on DatelineI came to stake my claim like a canine waitin' in a buffet lineSo, Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombreCome play, belly dance on me'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me

Girl, take this pole like a surveyToday wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert traySo we're in shape, 'cause you're in a slurrin' state
I’m a ten, you’re an eight
Like what I do before, after and durin' rape!
You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And be made a fool out of when I pull on 'em?
R. Kelly with a full bladderNon-high school grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge
My degrees is the same as I got in college (zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respectI owe you nada like Haloti, partnerBlow me, told you I'm so dirty, homie
You can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on and get the soap and try to
Get the Pope to hold me while you hose me off
And nope, I won't be washedYou hope to God I don't explode
I gotta blow this spot up though, I got a lotta mo'I won't put the sugar coating on it though'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crapBut look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone
Uh huh, I get why you're tappedBut you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back'Cause sometimes I might get sad
But I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad: don't cry, get mad'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bagsI'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass (sodomy!)Foot up it, I stood up for the kid
Who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)You ain't have to have no money
Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitudeNow my dough's amountin' to a mountain
It's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish
I had a dime for every time that I was doubtedBut then I think about it, then I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wageBut it's embedded in my head I never
Hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of butI'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and bloodI put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
Will they put me on a pedestal
Or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause
I'll never get another mothafuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can simply because I can'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some wormsI hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
I hope you offended
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds"

Percent of what I rapped aboutMaybe I shoulda did a better job at separating

It's the craziest shit I
Ever seen, and back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration

I love you, Bean, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging meAnd it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday

I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloudI just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you graduate in your caps and gownsIt's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?I've got so much more to do
And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and youYou gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for schoolDoody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
So many things—time, I'd give anything to rewind itI had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'causeThat image burned in my brain of you on that table

I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when rememberingAnd, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at itOh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you
You taught me what not to doAnd, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with youDoody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the roomNurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset
I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecksWith every second, each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow
Then a breath, machines go (*beep beep beep*)
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shitI'm tryna rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength
To remind me, even if a steep climb I must takeTo rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape

That I'm a good person, though they portray me as coldAnd if things should worsen, but I bet you they won'tI'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be backI'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the pastConsider the last four minutes as
The song I'da sang to my daughters
